# ICSpark Mentor Project: Data Types, Arrays, Objects

A simple demonstration project making use of objects, arrays, and data types such as numbers. In this project, we will create a simple showcase of things you like.

### Part 1: Initial file setup

Create your HTML, CSS, and JS files:
- index.html
- style.css
- app.js

### Part 2: Prepare the HTML file

In your index.html file, create a div in the body that includes the following elements (header titles do not have to be identical, but this is a starting point):
- img with an id like "visual" or another similar id
- a header with "name:"
- a header or p with the id "obj-name"
- a header with "type:"
- a p with the id "desc"

Outside of the div you just made, create two buttons containing the text "left" and "right" respectively. As with some of the elements in the div, include an id for each one (i.e. "left-button" for the left one, and "right-button" for the one on the right. The buttons can either come before or after the div.

### Part 3: Prepare the CSS file

In your style.css file, create a simple CSS selector for the div element. For now, we can just select a border style.

### Part 4: Prepare the JS file

This is where you can apply what you learned about objects, arrays, and data types. 

First we will start with the objects:

#### Part 4a: Creating objects

First, think of something you like. This could be anything, from your favorite foods, games, places, or characters. Find an image to represent what you chose. 

In your Javascript window, create an object called object1. In your new object, include the following properties:

- imgsrc
- name
- type
- desc
